Face Recognition Attendance System using CNN
A Python-based system that registers faces, recognizes them in real-time, and records attendance in a CSV file.

This project implements a CNN-based face recognition system to automate attendance tracking. It:

Registers new faces via webcam.
Trains a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to recognize faces.
Marks attendance in real-time and logs it to attendance.csv.
