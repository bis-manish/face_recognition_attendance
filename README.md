Face Recognition Attendance System using CNN
A Python-based system that registers faces, recognizes them in real-time, and records attendance in a CSV file.

Python
TensorFlow
OpenCV

This project implements a CNN-based face recognition system to automate attendance tracking. It:

Registers new faces via webcam.
Trains a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to recognize faces.
Marks attendance in real-time and logs it to attendance.csv.

Key Features:
✔ Real-time face detection using Haar Cascades.
✔ CNN model for high-accuracy recognition.
✔ CSV-based attendance logging with timestamps.
✔ Modular code for easy customization.
